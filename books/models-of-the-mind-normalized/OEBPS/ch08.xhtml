<p class="TXT">In the mid-1990s, a local newspaper editor in Houston, Texas, went to Baylor College of Medicine hoping to get help with a problem concerning his left hand. For the past several weeks, the fingers of this hand had been weak and the fingertips had gone numb. The man, a heavy smoker and drinker, appeared to the doctors to be in decent health otherwise. Seeing the numbness, the doctors initially searched for a pinched nerve in his wrist. Finding nothing there, they checked the spinal cord, suspecting that a lesion in the spinal nerves might be to blame. When evidence for that too came back negative, the doctors went one step further and performed a scan of the brain. What they found was a tumour – the size of a large grape – lodged into the right side of the wrinkled surface of the man’s brain. It was halfway between his right temple and the top of his head, in the middle of a region known as the motor cortex.</p>
<p class="TXI">The motor cortex takes the shape of two thin strips starting at the top of the head and running down each side, together forming a headband across the top of the <a id="page_216"></a>brain.<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnt-1">1</a>
</sup> Different parts of each strip control different parts of the opposite side of the body. In the case of the newspaper editor, his tumour was in the hand-controlling region of the right motor cortex. It also extended a bit into the sensory cortex – a similarly arranged strip right behind the motor cortex that controls sensation. This placement explained the weakness and numbness respectively – problems that subsided after the surgical removal of the tumour.</p>
<p class="TXI">Since its discovery roughly 150 years ago, the motor cortex has found itself at the centre of many controversies. That the brain controls the body is undisputed; data from injuries indicated this fact as early as the pyramid age of ancient Egypt. But <span class="italic">how</span> it does so is another question.</p>
<p class="TXI">In some ways, the connection between the motor cortex and movement is straightforward. It’s a connection that follows a path opposite to the investigation taken by the Baylor doctors: neurons in the motor cortex on one side of the brain send outputs to neurons in the spinal cord on the other side, and these spinal cord neurons go directly to specific muscle fibres. The spot where the spinal cord neuron meets the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction. When this neuron fires, it releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into this junction. Muscle fibres respond to acetylcholine by <a id="page_217"></a>contracting and movement occurs. Through this path, neurons in the cortex can directly control muscles. </p>
<p class="TXI">But this is not the only road between the motor cortex and muscle. The other paths are more meandering. Some motor cortex neurons, for example, send their outputs to intermediate areas such as the brainstem, basal ganglia and cerebellum. From these areas the connections then go on to the spinal cord. Each such pit stop offers an opportunity for further processing of the signal, causing a change in the message that gets sent to the muscles. Furthermore, even the most direct paths aren’t necessarily simple; neurons from the motor cortex can connect with multiple different neurons in the spinal cord, which each activate and inhibit different muscle groups. In this way, there are many channels through which the cortex can communicate with the muscles and many possible messages that could be sent. Rather than direct, the influence of the motor cortex on the body can actually be highly distributed. </p>
<p class="TXI">On top of this confusion, the very need for the motor cortex has been called into question. When the cortex is disconnected from the rest of the brain, animals don’t initiate many complex movements on their own, but they can still perform some well-worn responsive behaviours. For example, such ‘decorticated’ cats will claw and strike if restrained, and decorticated male rats still manage to copulate if a female is around. Therefore, for some of the most important behaviours for survival, the motor cortex seems superfluous.</p>
<p class="TXI">Movement – as the only way the brain can communicate with the world – is a crucial piece of the neuroscience puzzle. Yet, the precise purpose of the <a id="page_218"></a>motor cortex is debated and its anatomy is of little help in understanding it either. Without these inroads, it’s hard to know exactly what the motor cortex is trying to say. But given the many significant motivations to sort out the riddle of movement – curing motor diseases, creating human-like robots, <span class="italic">etc.</span> – a steady stream of scientists has been trying. In the early days, this took the form of bitter arguments over what kind of movement the motor cortex generates. This was followed by a march of mathematical methods for making sense of the activity of its neurons. While some of its wilder debates have been brought under control, the study of the motor cortex – perhaps more than most areas of neuroscience – remains in tumultuous times even today. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig both studied medicine at the University of Berlin in the mid-nineteenth century, though their paths did not cross there. After medical school – the story goes – Fritsch was dressing a head wound as part of his service in the second Danish–Prussian War when he realised that certain irritations of the exposed brain caused muscle spasms in the opposite side of the soldier’s body. Hitzig, on the other hand, was purportedly operating an electroshock-therapy business when he noticed that shocks to particular parts of the head elicited eye movements. Each doctor was struck by his own curious observation and the implications it could have. Fritsch and Hitzig finally met when Fritsch returned to Berlin in the late 1860s. The pair decided to join forces to <a id="page_219"></a>explore what was then considered an absurd hypothesis: that the cortex could control movement.</p>
<p class="TXI">The notion that the cortex did anything at all was considered radical at the time. Cortex – from the latin for ‘rind’ – was thought of as an inert outer shell, a layer of neural tissue covering the important areas of the brain underneath. This view came from several previous experiments that attempted to stimulate the cortex, but failed to elicit any interesting responses (in hindsight it is clear that this was due mostly to inappropriate stimulation techniques, such as pinching, poking or dousing the cortex with alcohol). But Fritsch, an international traveller who dabbled in many fields,<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnt-2">2</a>
</sup> and Hitzig, a stern, proud and vain man, were driven by their own curiosity and arrogance to push through the barrier of established beliefs.</p>
<p class="TXI">So, on a table in Hitzig’s home (the Physiological Institute didn’t have the facilities for this new technique), Fritsch and Hitzig began electrically stimulating the cortex of dogs. They prepared a platinum electrode by attaching it to a battery and tapping it on their tongue to test the strength (reportedly it was ‘of sufficient intensity to cause a distinct sensation’). They then touched the tip of the electrode very briefly to different areas of the exposed brain, while observing any movements that came as a result. What they found was that stimulating the cortex could indeed produce movements – short twitches or spasms of small groups of muscles on the <a id="page_220"></a>opposite side of the body. And the location of the stimulation mattered – it determined which body part, if any, would move. </p>
<p class="TXI">This latter finding was perhaps even more heretical than the first. At this time even the handful of scientists who thought the cortex might do something useful still assumed that it worked as an undifferentiated mass – a web of tissue without functional specialisation. It wasn’t supposed to have an orderly arrangement, wherein all the motor functions sit at one strip across the front of the brain. Yet this is what Fritsch and Hitzig’s stimulations were suggesting. Further testing their theory, after Fritsch and Hitzig mapped out the bit of the brain responsible for a certain body area, they would cut it out and observe the adverse effects this had on movement. In general, such lesions did not cause complete paralysis of the affected body part, but they did significantly impair its control and function. The evidence for a motor cortex was mounting. </p>
<p class="TXI">The work of this German duo coincided with findings by another doctor, John Hughlings Jackson, that also implicated this region of the brain in motor control in humans. These joint findings made the mid-nineteenth century a turning point for the role of the cortex in movement – and in neuroscience more generally. Scientists were forced to contend with the idea that not only might the cortex be doing something, but that sub-portions of the cortex might even have different functions. Excited by these turbulent times, a mentee of Jackson’s named David Ferrier set out to study the cortex in detail.</p>
<p class="TXI">In 1873, Ferrier was given the opportunity to carry out experiments on the motor system at the West Riding <a id="page_221"></a>Lunatic Asylum. Working at this prestigious Victorian mental institution and research facility, Ferrier was able to replicate the findings of Fritsch and Hitzig – both the stimulation and the lesion results – in dogs. He also showed that the same principles applied in a whole host of other animals including jackals, cats, rabbits, rats, fish and frogs. Ferrier then went on a detailed expedition into the motor area of monkeys, hoping to provide a map that would help surgeons safely remove tumours and blood clots from human brains.<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnt-3">3</a>
</sup> </p>
<p class="TXI">Testing a zoo’s worth of species wasn’t the only way Ferrier expanded on Fritsch and Hitzig’s work: he also updated the stimulation technology. The galvanic stimulation used by Fritsch and Hitzig was a form of direct current, which could be damaging to the tissue of the brain. As such, it could only be applied in brief pulses. Ferrier eventually switched to faradic stimulation, an alternating current that could be applied more consistently. As a result, Ferrier could hold the electrode to the brain for several seconds. He could also stimulate at higher strengths – ‘sufficient to cause a pungent, but quite bearable, sensation when the electrodes were placed on the tip of the tongue’, according to Ferrier.</p> <a id="page_222"></a>
<p class="TXI">This quantitative change in stimulation parameters led to a qualitative shift in results. When Ferrier stimulated at longer intervals, he didn’t just get longer muscle twitches. Instead, the animals displayed full, complex movements – movements reminiscent of ones they would make in their ordinary lives. For example, Ferrier found a part of the rabbit brain that, according to his notes, elicited ‘sudden retraction and elevation or pricking up of the opposite ear – this occasionally coinciding with a sudden start, apparently as if the animal were about to bound forward’. In the cat, a particular area was responsible for ‘retraction and adduction of the fore-leg. Rapidly performed, the movement is such as the cat makes when striking a ball with its paw.’ And when stimulating a spot ‘situated on the posterior half of the superior and middle frontal convolutions’ of the monkey brain, Ferrier observed ‘the eyes open widely, the pupils dilate, and head and eyes turn towards the opposite side’.</p>
<p class="TXI">That such a blunt stimulation of the motor cortex conjures such smooth and coordinated movements points to a different understanding of this brain region from Fritsch and Hitzig’s. If motor cortex stimulation primarily drives small isolated muscle groups – as those two believed – then its duty is relatively rudimentary. Different portions of motor cortex work like keys on a piano, each producing its own single note. Ferrier’s findings, on the other hand, cast the motor cortex as a library of short melodies – where each stimulation causes a fragment of movement to play out cooperatively across multiple muscle groups. This argument – notes versus melodies, twitches versus movements – would be the first of many debates over the soul of the motor cortex.</p><a id="page_223"></a>
<p class="TXI">Despite the fact that he replicated their findings, Fritsch and Hitzig didn’t get along with Ferrier. This may have stemmed from a tiff over credit assignment. Ferrier felt that the German duo had slighted his mentor Jackson by not citing Jackson’s work in their own. As a result, Ferrier tried to get away with not citing Fitsch and Hitzig in his. He even went so far as to remove all references to his experiments in dogs and only talk about the results from monkeys in order to avoid any connection to Fitch and Hitzig.<sup><a href="#fn-4" id="fnt-4">4</a>
</sup> </p>
<p class="TXI">Whatever the reason, Fritsch and Hitzig didn’t trust Ferrier’s work showing the production of natural movement fragments. They stood by the superiority of short galvanic stimulation, and claimed that Ferrier’s stimulation was too long and that his findings were not replicable. Ferrier, on the other hand, remained steadfast in his belief that faradic current was best and that the quick galvanic application of Fritsch and Hitzig ‘fails to call forth the definite purposive combination of muscular contractions, which is the very essence of the reaction and the key to its interpretation’.</p>
<p class="TXI">As this fight raged on in the tiny microcosm of motor cortex stimulation, the larger field of neuroscience was having a different discussion. That function in the cortex is localised – that different areas play different roles – was something the motor crowd had clearly accepted. But in <a id="page_224"></a>the broader community, this radical change in understanding was still only just sinking in and many researchers at the time made it their goal to test the limits of this theory. Thus, the fashion became to try to stimulate as small an area of the cortex as possible to see just how localised the function could get. This trend aligned very well with Fritsch and Hitzig’s approach of using short small pulses to cause individual muscle movements. Their preferred method thus became dominant – not because it was the right way to answer the scientific question of what the motor cortex does, but because the scientific question had changed. Under the influence of the localisation craze, the fact that small muscle movements could be elicited by stimulation was more important than whether the brain normally produces movement this way. The problem of ‘twitches versus movements’ was thus put on the back burner for more than a century. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">In the brain, it doesn’t get more local than a single neuron. Neuroscientists have had the ability to record the activity of single neurons since the late 1920s. However, doing so usually required an experimental set-up – say, removing the neural tissue from the animals or at least anesthetising them during the recording – that prohibited the concurrent study of behaviour. This changed in the late 1950s, when electrodes were developed that could be dropped into the brain of an awake and responsive monkey to eavesdrop on the electrical signal of individual neurons. Reflecting on this turn in the history of neuroscience <a id="page_225"></a>some 50 years later, pioneering neuroscientist Vernon Mountcastle remarked that the field ‘has never been the same since, and one can scarcely exaggerate the thrill it was for those of us who had spent years working with anesthetised or reduced preparations to see and to work with the brain in action!’ The study of motor control – of the way in which movement and behaviour is generated by the brain – perhaps had the most to gain from this experimental advance. And indeed motor scientists were the first to use it.</p>
<p class="TXI">One of these early researchers was Edward Evarts, a psychiatrist from New York. Evarts was a generous but strict man. He took his work very personally – even turning to introspection and personal experience to aid his scientific studies on sleep and exercise – and he expected similar dedication from others. In 1967, while working at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, he finished a solo three-part project on the responses of neurons in the motor cortex. The final portion of this study focused on a question that would form the core of motor neuroscience for decades to come: what aspects of movement do neurons in the motor cortex represent?</p>
<p class="TXI">To ask this question, Evarts used a simple motor task that required only a small amount of movement. Specifically, he trained monkeys to hold on to a vertical rod and move it left and right. The monkeys were constrained to do so using only a single joint, the wrist. This meant the movement was controlled solely by two muscle groups in the forearm: the flexors, which bring the hand towards the body, and extensors, which pull it back the other way.</p> <a id="page_226"></a>
<p class="TXI">One simple hypothesis was that the firing rates of neurons in the motor cortex were directly related to the position the wrist was in at any given moment. If this were the case, you’d find neurons that fire strongly when the wrist is flexed but not when it is extended and other neurons that do the opposite. </p>
<p class="TXI">When studying movement, it makes sense to turn to the well-established mathematics of motion. An additional hypothesis for Evarts’ study therefore came from <span class="italic">kinetics</span>, the part of physics that deals with the causes of motion.<sup><a href="#fn-5" id="fnt-5">5</a>
</sup> To make the hand move, muscles in the arm contract, generating force. This force from the muscles gets turned into angular force, or torque, when it acts on the wrist joint. The torque then determines the movement and position of the hand. If motor cortex neurons encoded force instead of position, some neurons would fire strongly when the flexor muscles were producing force that moved the wrist in one direction and other neurons would fire when the extensor muscles were producing force that moves it in the other direction. </p>
<p class="TXI">In the most basic form of this experiment, these two hypotheses are indistinguishable. If a neuron is firing when the wrist is in the flexed position, is it because the wrist is in the flexed position or because of the force needed to keep it there? Who knows? If he wanted to test between these two hypotheses, Evarts needed to dissociate these two aspects of movement. To do so, he simply added counterweights to the rod. Like setting the weight on a machine at the gym, adding different counterweights to the rod makes the movements easier <a id="page_227"></a>or harder. This changes the amount of force needed to move the rod to the same position. Now firing rates could be compared when the wrist is in the same position but using different forces to get there.</p>
<p class="TXI">When looking at the 31 neurons in the motor cortex from which he recorded, Evarts saw that 26 of them had firing rates that were clearly related to force. Some of these responded strongly during wrist flexion and increased their firing as weights were added that made that flexion more difficult (or decreased their firing when weight was added in the opposite direction, making flexion easier). Other neurons preferred extensions, showing the same pattern but in the opposite direction. The remaining five neurons were difficult to interpret, but none of them showed activity that related directly to wrist position. These results made a strong case for the argument that the motor cortex encodes force.</p>
<p class="TXI">Evarts’ work on wrist forces set in motion a long trajectory of searching for kinetics in the motor system. Over the ensuing years, several other research groups sought and found kinetic information in the firing rates of motor cortex neurons as animals carried out simple movements. The legacy of localisation remains visible in this approach; it aims, after all, to understand the behaviour of individual neurons and small isolated muscle movements. But it unifies that understanding under the broader, pre-existing mathematical system of kinetics. In this view, the mathematics of the motor cortex can be found in the equations of any standard physics textbook.</p>
<p class="TXI">Evarts established the modern approach to the study of the motor cortex. He provided a well-controlled <a id="page_228"></a>experiment to explore how the activity of an individual neuron relates to the activity of muscles, and he pointed to the mathematics that could contextualise such findings. Within a few decades, however, the majority of Evarts’ signature contributions to motor science would be upended and the next era of tumult in the field would begin. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="EXT">
<span class="italic">Ah, the motor system! For better or worse, there is no coherent view of motor function by systems neuroscientists … You still have the muscle diehards [who] contend that all neural activity in motor structures, from the cerebellum to cortex, has somehow to be explained, by default, with reference to that one, real or virtual, muscle. Of course, it doesn’t make any sense… natural movements rarely, if ever, involve just one muscle.</span></p>
<p class="TXT">These are the words of Apostolos Georgopoulos, a Greek-born professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. By the time he said this in 1998, Georgopoulos had been shaking up the field of motor neuroscience for more than 15 years. Three major conceptual advances are associated with Georgopoulos (though, of course, none of them came solely from him – they existed in some form already in the scientific milieu) and of those three contributions, two remain central to the study of the motor cortex to this day. </p>
<p class="TXI">His first contribution is predictable from his quote: a focus on natural movements. Georgopoulos had trained with the famed sensory neuroscientist Vernon Mount­castle and was heavily influenced by his way of thinking. <a id="page_229"></a>Mountcastle took a holistic approach to studying the brain. He asked how bodily sensations were represented at every step – from tactile-sensing neurons in the skin up through to the use of this sensory information by higher cognitive functions in the brain. Georgopoulos wanted to bring the study of motor control into the grand tradition set upon by Mountcastle in sensory systems. In this pursuit, Georgopoulos knew he had to do away with studies of stilted single-joint movements. To understand how movement information was represented and processed by the brain, he needed to study it in the context of natural movements, in their full multi-muscle complexity. For this, he turned to one of the most basic and essential movements in a primate’s repertoire: reaching.</p>
<p class="TXI">To reach for an object in front of you, you rely on the team of muscles that surround the joints of the arm. This unsurprisingly includes the muscles of the upper arms such as the biceps and triceps. But it also involves the anterior pectoralis (a band that crosses from the centre of the chest to the arm), the anterior deltoid (a strip just in front of the armpit) and the broadest muscle in the back, the latissimus dorsi, which stretches from the lower back up to the under arm. Depending on the details of the reach, the wrist and fingers may need to be involved as well. This multi-muscle movement is a far cry from the wrist-bend experiments of Evarts. </p>
<p class="TXI">To study this multifaceted task, Georgopoulos trained monkeys to work on a small light-up table. The animals held in their hand a rod, just like you’d hold a wooden spoon when stirring a big pot. This rod was connected to a measurement device and, when a light turned on that indicated where to reach, the animals moved the <a id="page_230"></a>rod to that location. The lights were arranged in a circle, like the numbers on the face of a clock, with a radius about the length of a playing card. The monkeys always returned to the centre of the circle before reaching to the next location. With eight evenly spaced lights in the circle, the animals thus made movements in eight different directions. This simple set-up became part of a tradition of studying ‘centre-out’ reaching in motor neuroscience (see Figure 18).</p>
<p class="image-fig" id="fig18.jpg">
<img alt="" src="Images/chapter-08-image-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="FC">
<span class="bold">
<span class="italic">Figure 18</span>
</span></p>
<p class="TXI">For his second contribution, Georgopoulos targeted Evarts’ kinetics theory – and replaced it with his 
own take on what neurons in the motor cortex were representing. </p>
<p class="TXI">Evarts had used wrist-flicks to see that neural activity represented force, but some scientists had found this relationship inconsistent. During more complex movements in particular, the amount of force that a muscle produces changes as the joints and muscles around it do. Moving the shoulder, for example, changes the physics of the elbow. This makes the chain of influence that runs from neural activity to muscle activity to force less interpretable and the kinetic theory <a id="page_231"></a>less viable. There were also indications that plenty of neurons cared very little about force at all. </p>
<p class="TXI">So Georgopoulos flipped the perspective. Rather than asking what neurons were saying about the muscles, he asked what they were saying about the movement. In more than a third of the neurons in motor cortex, he found a very clear and simple relationship between neural activity and the <span class="italic">direction</span> the arm was moving. Specifically, these neurons had a preferred direction. This means they would fire the most when the animal reached in that direction – say towards three o’clock – and their rate of firing would fall off the farther the movement was from this direction (lower firing for two and four o’clock, lower still for one and five o’clock, <span class="italic">etc.</span>). The finding of this ‘direction tuning’ implied that the motor cortex cared more about <span class="italic">kinematics</span> than kinetics. After ‘twitches vs movements’, kinetics vs kinematics became the next big debate in motor neuroscience. </p>
<p class="TXI">Kinematics are descriptive features of motion, defined without regard to the forces that generate them. In this way, kinematic variables indicate the desired outcome for the arm, but not the instructions for how to create it. Going from a model wherein the motor cortex encodes kinetics to one wherein it encodes kinematics shifts the distribution of labour in the motor system. A kinetic variable such as force is only a few small calculations removed from the actual level of muscle activity needed to enact it – transformations potentially performed by neurons in the spinal cord – but because kinematic values only define where the arm should be in space, they pose a larger challenge to the rest of the motor system. The burden is thus on areas downstream of the <a id="page_232"></a>motor cortex to change the coordinate system: to take a set of desired locations external to the body and turn it into patterns of muscle activity. Georgopoulos became an adamant and unceasing defender of this kinematic take on the motor cortex for decades to come. </p>
<p class="TXI">The final change ushered in by Georgopoulos was in how to look at the data. If neurons are tuned to the overall direction of the movement, it means that they are not involved in one-to-one control of muscles. Why, then, should neurons be looked at one at a time? Instead, it would be more sensible to consider what all the neurons – the entire population – are saying.</p>
<p class="TXI">And that is what Georgopoulos did. Using the information he had about direction tuning in individual cells, he calculated a ‘population vector’ – essentially an arrow that points in the direction of movement that the neural population is encoding. This calculation works by allowing each neuron to vote for its preferred direction of movement. But this is no perfect democracy, because not all votes are weighted equally. Instead the weight of a neuron’s vote comes from how active the neuron is. So, neurons firing high above average can strongly bias the population vector in their preferred direction. And neurons firing well below average would bias this vector <span class="italic">away</span> from their preferred direction. In this way, the neurons collectively indicate the desired movement direction. And they do so in a way that is more accurate than an individual neuron can be.<sup><a href="#fn-6" id="fnt-6">6</a>
</sup> Georgopoulos <a id="page_233"></a>showed that by summing up each neuron’s contribution in this way he could, in fact, accurately read out the direction in which the animal was moving its arm on any given instance. </p>
<p class="TXI">This population-level approach to the data proved quite powerful – perhaps too powerful. After this work, several studies emerged showing other information that could be read out from the motor cortex if the whole population was taken into account: finger movement, arm speed, muscle activity, force, position and even sensory information about the visual cues indicating where and when to move. Direction may have been one of the original variables decoded in this way, but it was far from unique. Finding both kinetic and kinematic variables (and a host of other information) in the activity was a blow against Georgopoulos’ theory that kinematics is special. Ironically, it was one of his own contributions – a focus on the population – that undermined him. </p>
<p class="TXI">Faith in what information read out from the motor cortex tells us about its function declined even further through the use of computational approaches. Scientists who built models of the motor system, which they <span class="italic">designed</span> to work by encoding kinetic variables, were able to show how kinematic variables could be read out from them as well. One such scientist – Eberhard Fetz – went so far as to compare the hunt for variable representations in the motor cortex to the behaviour of fortune tellers: <a id="page_234"></a>‘Like reading tea leaves, this approach can be used to create an impression, by projecting conceptual schemes on to suggestive patterns.’ </p>
<p class="TXI">These findings revealed a possibility that was always lurking just under the surface: there is no single value that neurons in the motor cortex ‘code for’. It’s not kinematics <span class="italic">or</span> kinetics; it’s both, and more, and neither. In many ways, this fact was visible all along. It could be seen in the neurons that didn’t show neat responses to force or direction, or in the neurons that showed big changes in their responses with small changes in the experiment, or simply in the decades-long volley of researchers finding evidence for one side and then the other over and over again.</p>
<p class="TXI">By some accounts, the field was led astray because it blindly followed the path laid by other scientists: the study of sensory systems that so inspired Georgopoulos was a poor model for how to understand movement. The debate over ‘what does the motor cortex encode?’ was unresolved not because the question is hard, but because it was the wrong one to ask from the start. The motor system doesn’t need to track movement parameters, it just needs to produce movements. </p>
<p class="TXI">As was shown in the last chapter, just because scientists can see structure in neural activity doesn’t mean the brain is using it. A common analogy compares the motor cortex to the engine of a car. The engine is surely responsible for the movement of the car. And if one were to measure the activity of its different parts – the piston, the engine belts, <span class="italic">etc.</span> – it’s likely that some of these values would, under some conditions, correlate quite strongly with the force generated by the car or with the direction <a id="page_235"></a>in which it is turning. But would we say the engine works by ‘encoding’ these variables? Or is this more a convention brought to the motor cortex by scientists who themselves understand movement through concepts of force, mechanics and physics? As motor neuroscientist John Kalaska wrote in 2009: ‘Joint torque is a Newtonian mechanical parameter that defines the rotational force required to produce a particular joint motion … It is highly unlikely that a [motor cortex] neuron knows what a Newton-meter is or how to calculate how many Newton-meters are needed to generate a particular movement.’</p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">Just because ‘what does the motor cortex encode?’ was the wrong question to ask to understand the motor cortex doesn’t mean the answer has no value. Indeed, trying to decode information from the motor cortex can be quite useful – not in aid of understanding the motor system, but in bypassing it altogether. </p>
<p class="TXI">When, in a small room outside Providence, Rhode Island, a 55-year-old woman named Cathy Hutchinson brought a cup of coffee to her mouth and took a sip, it was the first time she’d done so in more than 15 years. It was also the first time any tetraplegic person achieved this feat. Hutchinson became paralysed from the neck down when she was 39, after suffering a stroke while gardening on a spring day in 1996. According to a <span class="italic">Wired</span> interview, she heard about BrainGate – a research group housed at Brown University that explores the use of brain-computer interfaces to restore mobility to <a id="page_236"></a>patients – from a friend who worked at the hospital. Hutchinson enrolled in their clinical trial.</p>
<p class="TXI">As part of their study, the BrainGate scientists implanted a device in Cathy’s brain – a square piece of metal smaller than the average shirt button, consisting of 96 electrodes, placed in the arm-controlling region of her left motor cortex. The activities of neurons recorded through these electrodes are fed through a wire out of her head and into a computer system. This machine connects to a robotic arm placed on a stand to Cathy’s right. The arm itself is alien – bulbous, awkward and a shiny blue – but the hand at the end of it is more recognisable, with subtle detailed joints in a matte silver. When Cathy controls it, the movements are not smooth. The arm halts and moves backwards before eventually bringing the coffee towards her. But ultimately it gets the job done – and a woman who lost the ability to move her own limbs gained the ability to move this one. </p>
<p class="TXI">Even this simple, imperfect control did not come immediately. For the machine to know how to listen to Cathy’s motor cortex it had to be trained. BrainGate achieves this by having Cathy imagine moving her arm in different directions. The patterns in the neural activity can then be related to commands to move the arm in different directions. In this way, the control of this brain-computer interface depends on the presence of direction tuning in the motor cortex. That is, if it weren’t possible to read out movement direction – and other intentions such as grasp or release – from a population of motor cortex cells, brain-computer interfaces wouldn’t work. </p>
<p class="TXI">These devices also depend on a lot of heavy mathematical machinery that runs behind the scenes. To <a id="page_237"></a>try to make the movements as smooth as possible, for example, BrainGate uses an algorithm that combines input from the neural activity with information about past movement direction. Furthermore, some of the fine-grained movements of the robot hand and wrist are pre-programmed into the device, so that the user can initiate a full, detailed motor sequence by imagining a simple command. This is a practical workaround for how difficult it is to read out detailed motor commands from the activity of a group of neurons. </p>
<p class="TXI">Such laboured efforts to build brain-controlled motor devices, while offering some hope to patients, highlight just how little we understand the role the motor cortex plays in healthy movement. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">If decoding is more useful for engineering than understanding, what <span class="italic">can</span> we use to make sense of the motor cortex? </p>
<p class="TXI">Focusing on the population has remained popular – and with good reason. The neurons of the motor cortex must to some extent be working together to generate movements; after all, the human motor cortex is allotted hundreds of millions of neurons to control the roughly 800 muscles of the human body. But this poses a challenge for scientists: how can they make sense of the activity of the hundreds of neurons normally recorded in the course of an experiment? In the population vector approach taken by Georgopoulos, beliefs about what the neurons were doing was built in: if the neurons are encoding direction, then direction is what is read out. <a id="page_238"></a>But as motor neuroscientists tried to move away from the question of what the motor cortex encodes to what the motor cortex <span class="italic">does</span>, approaches based on reading out specific information didn’t make sense. They needed to find a new way to look at the population. </p>
<p class="TXI">The fundamental difference between a single neuron vs a population approach to the study of the motor cortex is one of <span class="italic">dimensionality</span>. While the space we live in is three-dimensional, many of the systems scientists study have much higher dimensionality. The activity of a population of 100 neurons, for example, would be 100-dimensional. </p>
<p class="TXI">How this abstract, high-dimensional ‘neural space’ relates at all to real, tangible, physical space can be difficult to see. But we can build off our intuitions about physical space by first considering a population with only three neurons. Specifically, by replacing metres or feet with the number of spikes a neuron fires, the activity of this population can be described just like a location in space. When producing a movement, for example, the first neuron in the population may fire five spikes, the second fifteen, and the third nine. This provides coordinates in neural space, the same way a treasure map describes how many paces to walk forwards, then to the right, then how deep to dig. A different pattern of neural activity would point to a different location in neural space. By looking at the neural activity of the motor cortex across a variety of movements, scientists can ask if different locations in this space correspond to different types or components of movement. </p>
<p class="TXI">Visualising this activity, though, becomes tricky in a larger population. Humans, based as we are in our <a id="page_239"></a>three-dimensional world, have trouble thinking beyond it. What would neural space look like if a fourth neuron were added to the population? What if there were a hundred neurons, or a thousand? Our intuitions fall apart here. Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton offers the best advice for this problem: ‘To deal with hyper-planes in a fourteen-dimensional space, visualise a 3-D space and say “fourteen” to yourself very loudly.’</p>
<p class="TXI">Luckily there is another way around the problem of having too many dimensions: dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is a mathematical technique that can take information in a high-dimensional space and represent it using fewer dimensions. It is based on the premise that some of these original dimensions are redundant – in this case, that would mean that multiple neurons are saying the same thing. If you could figure out what patterns of neural activity in a 100-dimension population are fundamental to that population – and which are just recycled combinations of those fundamental patterns – you could explain that neural population with fewer than 100 dimensions. </p>
<p class="TXI">Consider personality. How many dimensions are there to human personality? The English language has a dizzying list of possible descriptors: agreeable, flexible, self-critical, kind, forgiving, creative, charismatic, calm, intelligent, disciplined, aggressive, meticulous, serious, clever, and on and on and on. Each of these could be thought of as a separate dimension, with each person described by a location in this high-dimensional personality space based on how they score on them. But there are some personality traits that seem to correlate. For example, ‘clever’ people may also frequently be <a id="page_240"></a>considered ‘quick-witted’. Maybe it would be more appropriate to think of cleverness and quick-wittedness as two measures of the same underlying trait – perhaps we call it ‘intelligence’. If this is the case then the two dimensions representing cleverness and quick-wittedness in this space can be replaced by one for intelligence. This reduces the dimensionality. If there is only an occasional person who is clever but not quick-witted or quick-witted but not clever, then this reduction doesn’t sacrifice much. For the vast majority of people, describing them according to intelligence alone will tell us what we need to know about these aspects of their personality. </p>
<p class="TXI">Indeed, most popular personality tests are based on the premise that just a handful of core traits can explain the full human diversity. For example, the famed Myers-Briggs test claims personality has just four axes: intuition vs sensing, feeling vs thinking, introversion vs extraversion and perception vs judging. A more scientifically grounded approach (known as the Big Five) places the dimensionality of personality at five: agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness and openness. These are referred to as ‘latent’ factors, because they can be thought of as the basic underlying traits that generate the many different personality styles we see.</p>
<p class="TXI">The historic tradition in neuroscience of treating each neuron as a snowflake – unique and worthy of individual analysis – assumes that they are, in some sense, the base unit of the brain. That is, it assumes that nature has packaged the relevant dimensions into a neat cellular form. But just as our folk notions of personality over-represent its dimensionality, there are many reasons why the ‘true’ dimensionality of a neural population is likely <a id="page_241"></a>to be less than the number of neurons in it. For example, redundancy is a smart feature to have in any biological system. Neurons are noisy and can die, which makes a system with redundant ones more robust.<sup><a href="#fn-7" id="fnt-7">7</a>
</sup> Furthermore, neurons tend to be heavily interconnected. With all their talking back and forth with each other, it’s unlikely that any one of them can remain very independent. Instead, their activity becomes correlated the same way that the opinions of people in the same social circles start to converge. For these reasons, neural populations are ripe for applying dimensionality reduction techniques that can help identify the latent factors truly driving them. </p>
<p class="TXI">A popular dimensionality reduction technique for neural data is principal components analysis, or PCA (see Figure 19). PCA was invented in the 1930s and used extensively by psychologists to analyse mental traits and faculties. Because of how useful it is for making sense of big datasets, it’s now applied to all kinds of data across many fields. </p>
<p class="TXI">PCA works though a focus on <span class="italic">variance</span>. Variance refers to how spread out different data points are. If, for example, over the course of three nights a person sleeps for 8 hours, 8 hours and 5 minutes, and 7 hours and 55 minutes, they would be a low-variance sleeper. A high-variance sleeper may also sleep for 8 hours on average but would spread it out very differently over three nights – say 6 hours, 10 hours and 8 hours.</p> <a id="page_242"></a>
<p class="TXI">Dimensions with high variance are important because they can be quite informative. It’s easier, for example, to read the emotional state of someone who is sometimes quiet and sometimes screaming than a stoic who always has the same straight face. Similarly, it is easier to categorise people by traits that vary a lot across people, rather than ones that everyone has in common. Recognising the importance of variance, the goal of PCA is to find new dimensions – which are a combination of the original dimensions the same way intelligence could be a combination of cleverness and quick-wittedness – that capture as much of the variance in the data as possible. This means that knowing where a data point falls according to these new dimensions will still tell us a lot about it, even if there are fewer of them. </p>
<p class="TXI">For example, consider a two-neuron population whose activity we would like to describe with just a single number. Let’s say we recorded the activity of these two neurons during different movements, so for each movement we have a pair of numbers representing the number of spikes from each. If we plot these pairs using the x-axis for one neuron and the y-axis for another, we <a id="page_243"></a>may see that the data falls more or less along a line. That line then can be our new dimension. Now, instead of describing the activity during each movement as a pair of numbers we can describe it as a single number, which refers to where it falls on this line.</p>
<p class="image-fig" id="fig19.jpg">
<img alt="" src="Images/chapter-08-image-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="FC">
<span class="bold">
<span class="italic">Figure 19</span>
</span></p>
<p class="TXI">Reducing the dimensionality in this way does leave off some information. We don’t know, for example, how far the activity is from that line if we only describe where it falls on it – but the point is to pick the line that captures the most variance and thus loses the least information. </p>
<p class="TXI">If the data doesn’t fall along a line – that is, if the activity of the two neurons is not similar at all – then this won’t work very well. In that case we would say that this two-dimensional neural population is indeed using its full two dimensions and so can’t be reduced. But, as discussed previously, there are many reasons why, on average, some neural activity is redundant and so dimensionality reduction is possible. </p>
<p class="TXI">Dimensionality reduction has been successfully applied to all kinds of neural data over the years. PCA itself was applied as early as 1978, when it was used to show that the activity of eight neurons responsible for encoding the position of the knee could be well represented by just one or two dimensions. And the use of PCA in studies of the motor cortex has only ramped up in the past decade. This is because dimensionality reduction helps motor scientists see what would otherwise be hidden. Condensing the ups and downs of the activity of over a hundred neurons into a single line makes their patterns visible to the naked eye. Looking at the evolution of a population’s activity as a shape traced out in three dimensions allows scientists to use their <a id="page_244"></a>intuitions about space to understand what neurons are doing. Seeing these trajectories can therefore seed new stories about how the motor system works. </p>
<p class="TXI">Studies conducted in the lab of Krishna Shenoy at Stanford University in the early 2010s, for example, asked how the motor cortex <span class="italic">prepares</span> for movements. To do this, they trained monkeys to perform standard arm reaches, but they introduced a delay between when the location for the movement was given and when the animal should actually start moving. This made it possible to record from the motor cortex while it was preparing to move. </p>
<p class="TXI">The long-held assumption was that, in preparing for movements, motor cortex neurons would fire in a pattern similar to how they fire during the movement, just at lower overall rates. That is, they’d essentially be saying the same thing but quieter. In neural activity space, this would put the preparatory activity in the same direction as the movement activity, but just not quite as far along. However, by plotting a low-dimensional version of the neural activity as the animal planned for and then executed a movement, the researchers found this was not the case. The activity before the movement was not simply a restrained version of that during the movement; instead, it occupied a different area of the activity space entirely. </p>
<p class="TXI">This finding, while surprising, is consistent with a more modern view of the motor cortex. This new view puts emphasis on the fact that the motor cortex is a dynamical system – that the neurons within it interact in a way that makes them capable of producing complex patterns of activity over time. Because of these interactions between its neurons, the motor cortex has the ability to take in short, simple inputs, and produce <a id="page_245"></a>elaborate and extended outputs in return. What makes this so useful is that it means another brain region could decide where the arm should be, send that information to the motor cortex, and the motor cortex would produce the full trajectory of neural activity needed to make the arm get there.</p>
<p class="TXI">In this framework, the preparatory activity represents an ‘initial state’ of this dynamical system. Initial states define the location in activity space that the population starts at, but it is the connections among neurons that determine where it goes. In this way, initial states work a little like the entries to different water slides at the top of a platform: the location of the entry can have little to do with the course of the slide or where it ends up. Therefore, there is no reason preparatory activity needs to look like the activity during movement. All that matters is that the motor cortex gets to the right initial state and the connections among its own neurons will do the rest. </p>
<p class="TXI">This ‘dynamical systems’ view has the potential to explain why attempts to make sense of the motor cortex have been so confounded. Thinking of these neurons as part of a larger machinery – where some parts are guiding muscle movements in the moment, but others are planning for the next step – the diversity and malleability of their responses are more expected. This new take also, ironically, brings the field back to its roots. A model where a simple input can produce a complex output provides a nice fit to Ferrier’s findings that stimulation produces extended naturalistic movements. And Ferrier was indeed vindicated in the early 2000s, when Princeton professor Michael Graziano showed – using modern stimulation techniques – that half-second-long stimulation of the motor cortex elicits complex and <a id="page_246"></a>coordinated natural movements, such as bringing a hand to the mouth or a changing of facial expression. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">It is not uncommon for scientists to admit what they do not know. After all, science only exists in the gaps between knowledge, so identifying and recognising these gaps is an important part of the process. But researchers of the motor system seem particularly extreme in their declarations of ignorance. They fill paragraphs with talk of the ‘considerable debate’ in their field and how there is ‘remarkably little agreement regarding even the basic response properties of the motor cortex’. They are quick to admit as well that ‘a deep understanding of the motor cortex function still eludes us’ and that ‘it remains an open question how neural responses in the motor cortex relate to movement’. And in their more desperate moments they even ask: ‘Why has this seemingly simple question been so difficult to answer?’ </p>
<p class="TXI">While still couched in the dry detachment of academic writing, these words indicate an honest acknowledgement of an unfortunate truth: that despite being both one of the earliest areas of cortex ever explored and one of the first to have single neuron activity recorded during behaviour, the motor cortex still remains deeply, stubbornly mysterious. As we have seen, of course, this is not for lack of trying: heroic work and vigorous debates have marked the history of this field – and, certainly, many inroads have been made. Yet, few of the major controversies have been fully settled – save, presumably, for the issue of whether the motor cortex exists and the fact that it does something at all.</p>

<p class="TXT">In the mid-1990s, a local newspaper editor in Houston, Texas, went to Baylor College of Medicine hoping to get help with a problem concerning his left hand. For the past several weeks, the fingers of this hand had been weak and the fingertips had gone numb. The man, a heavy smoker and drinker, appeared to the doctors to be in decent health otherwise. Seeing the numbness, the doctors initially searched for a pinched nerve in his wrist. Finding nothing there, they checked the spinal cord, suspecting that a lesion in the spinal nerves might be to blame. When evidence for that too came back negative, the doctors went one step further and performed a scan of the brain. What they found was a tumour – the size of a large grape – lodged into the right side of the wrinkled surface of the man’s brain. It was halfway between his right temple and the top of his head, in the middle of a region known as the motor cortex.</p>
<p class="TXI">The motor cortex takes the shape of two thin strips starting at the top of the head and running down each side, together forming a headband across the top of the <a id="page_216"></a>brain.<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnt-1">1</a>
</sup> Different parts of each strip control different parts of the opposite side of the body. In the case of the newspaper editor, his tumour was in the hand-controlling region of the right motor cortex. It also extended a bit into the sensory cortex – a similarly arranged strip right behind the motor cortex that controls sensation. This placement explained the weakness and numbness respectively – problems that subsided after the surgical removal of the tumour.</p>
<p class="TXI">Since its discovery roughly 150 years ago, the motor cortex has found itself at the centre of many controversies. That the brain controls the body is undisputed; data from injuries indicated this fact as early as the pyramid age of ancient Egypt. But <span class="italic">how</span> it does so is another question.</p>
<p class="TXI">In some ways, the connection between the motor cortex and movement is straightforward. It’s a connection that follows a path opposite to the investigation taken by the Baylor doctors: neurons in the motor cortex on one side of the brain send outputs to neurons in the spinal cord on the other side, and these spinal cord neurons go directly to specific muscle fibres. The spot where the spinal cord neuron meets the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction. When this neuron fires, it releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into this junction. Muscle fibres respond to acetylcholine by <a id="page_217"></a>contracting and movement occurs. Through this path, neurons in the cortex can directly control muscles. </p>
<p class="TXI">But this is not the only road between the motor cortex and muscle. The other paths are more meandering. Some motor cortex neurons, for example, send their outputs to intermediate areas such as the brainstem, basal ganglia and cerebellum. From these areas the connections then go on to the spinal cord. Each such pit stop offers an opportunity for further processing of the signal, causing a change in the message that gets sent to the muscles. Furthermore, even the most direct paths aren’t necessarily simple; neurons from the motor cortex can connect with multiple different neurons in the spinal cord, which each activate and inhibit different muscle groups. In this way, there are many channels through which the cortex can communicate with the muscles and many possible messages that could be sent. Rather than direct, the influence of the motor cortex on the body can actually be highly distributed. </p>
<p class="TXI">On top of this confusion, the very need for the motor cortex has been called into question. When the cortex is disconnected from the rest of the brain, animals don’t initiate many complex movements on their own, but they can still perform some well-worn responsive behaviours. For example, such ‘decorticated’ cats will claw and strike if restrained, and decorticated male rats still manage to copulate if a female is around. Therefore, for some of the most important behaviours for survival, the motor cortex seems superfluous.</p>
<p class="TXI">Movement – as the only way the brain can communicate with the world – is a crucial piece of the neuroscience puzzle. Yet, the precise purpose of the <a id="page_218"></a>motor cortex is debated and its anatomy is of little help in understanding it either. Without these inroads, it’s hard to know exactly what the motor cortex is trying to say. But given the many significant motivations to sort out the riddle of movement – curing motor diseases, creating human-like robots, <span class="italic">etc.</span> – a steady stream of scientists has been trying. In the early days, this took the form of bitter arguments over what kind of movement the motor cortex generates. This was followed by a march of mathematical methods for making sense of the activity of its neurons. While some of its wilder debates have been brought under control, the study of the motor cortex – perhaps more than most areas of neuroscience – remains in tumultuous times even today. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig both studied medicine at the University of Berlin in the mid-nineteenth century, though their paths did not cross there. After medical school – the story goes – Fritsch was dressing a head wound as part of his service in the second Danish–Prussian War when he realised that certain irritations of the exposed brain caused muscle spasms in the opposite side of the soldier’s body. Hitzig, on the other hand, was purportedly operating an electroshock-therapy business when he noticed that shocks to particular parts of the head elicited eye movements. Each doctor was struck by his own curious observation and the implications it could have. Fritsch and Hitzig finally met when Fritsch returned to Berlin in the late 1860s. The pair decided to join forces to <a id="page_219"></a>explore what was then considered an absurd hypothesis: that the cortex could control movement.</p>
<p class="TXI">The notion that the cortex did anything at all was considered radical at the time. Cortex – from the latin for ‘rind’ – was thought of as an inert outer shell, a layer of neural tissue covering the important areas of the brain underneath. This view came from several previous experiments that attempted to stimulate the cortex, but failed to elicit any interesting responses (in hindsight it is clear that this was due mostly to inappropriate stimulation techniques, such as pinching, poking or dousing the cortex with alcohol). But Fritsch, an international traveller who dabbled in many fields,<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnt-2">2</a>
</sup> and Hitzig, a stern, proud and vain man, were driven by their own curiosity and arrogance to push through the barrier of established beliefs.</p>
<p class="TXI">So, on a table in Hitzig’s home (the Physiological Institute didn’t have the facilities for this new technique), Fritsch and Hitzig began electrically stimulating the cortex of dogs. They prepared a platinum electrode by attaching it to a battery and tapping it on their tongue to test the strength (reportedly it was ‘of sufficient intensity to cause a distinct sensation’). They then touched the tip of the electrode very briefly to different areas of the exposed brain, while observing any movements that came as a result. What they found was that stimulating the cortex could indeed produce movements – short twitches or spasms of small groups of muscles on the <a id="page_220"></a>opposite side of the body. And the location of the stimulation mattered – it determined which body part, if any, would move. </p>
<p class="TXI">This latter finding was perhaps even more heretical than the first. At this time even the handful of scientists who thought the cortex might do something useful still assumed that it worked as an undifferentiated mass – a web of tissue without functional specialisation. It wasn’t supposed to have an orderly arrangement, wherein all the motor functions sit at one strip across the front of the brain. Yet this is what Fritsch and Hitzig’s stimulations were suggesting. Further testing their theory, after Fritsch and Hitzig mapped out the bit of the brain responsible for a certain body area, they would cut it out and observe the adverse effects this had on movement. In general, such lesions did not cause complete paralysis of the affected body part, but they did significantly impair its control and function. The evidence for a motor cortex was mounting. </p>
<p class="TXI">The work of this German duo coincided with findings by another doctor, John Hughlings Jackson, that also implicated this region of the brain in motor control in humans. These joint findings made the mid-nineteenth century a turning point for the role of the cortex in movement – and in neuroscience more generally. Scientists were forced to contend with the idea that not only might the cortex be doing something, but that sub-portions of the cortex might even have different functions. Excited by these turbulent times, a mentee of Jackson’s named David Ferrier set out to study the cortex in detail.</p>
<p class="TXI">In 1873, Ferrier was given the opportunity to carry out experiments on the motor system at the West Riding <a id="page_221"></a>Lunatic Asylum. Working at this prestigious Victorian mental institution and research facility, Ferrier was able to replicate the findings of Fritsch and Hitzig – both the stimulation and the lesion results – in dogs. He also showed that the same principles applied in a whole host of other animals including jackals, cats, rabbits, rats, fish and frogs. Ferrier then went on a detailed expedition into the motor area of monkeys, hoping to provide a map that would help surgeons safely remove tumours and blood clots from human brains.<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnt-3">3</a>
</sup> </p>
<p class="TXI">Testing a zoo’s worth of species wasn’t the only way Ferrier expanded on Fritsch and Hitzig’s work: he also updated the stimulation technology. The galvanic stimulation used by Fritsch and Hitzig was a form of direct current, which could be damaging to the tissue of the brain. As such, it could only be applied in brief pulses. Ferrier eventually switched to faradic stimulation, an alternating current that could be applied more consistently. As a result, Ferrier could hold the electrode to the brain for several seconds. He could also stimulate at higher strengths – ‘sufficient to cause a pungent, but quite bearable, sensation when the electrodes were placed on the tip of the tongue’, according to Ferrier.</p> <a id="page_222"></a>
<p class="TXI">This quantitative change in stimulation parameters led to a qualitative shift in results. When Ferrier stimulated at longer intervals, he didn’t just get longer muscle twitches. Instead, the animals displayed full, complex movements – movements reminiscent of ones they would make in their ordinary lives. For example, Ferrier found a part of the rabbit brain that, according to his notes, elicited ‘sudden retraction and elevation or pricking up of the opposite ear – this occasionally coinciding with a sudden start, apparently as if the animal were about to bound forward’. In the cat, a particular area was responsible for ‘retraction and adduction of the fore-leg. Rapidly performed, the movement is such as the cat makes when striking a ball with its paw.’ And when stimulating a spot ‘situated on the posterior half of the superior and middle frontal convolutions’ of the monkey brain, Ferrier observed ‘the eyes open widely, the pupils dilate, and head and eyes turn towards the opposite side’.</p>
<p class="TXI">That such a blunt stimulation of the motor cortex conjures such smooth and coordinated movements points to a different understanding of this brain region from Fritsch and Hitzig’s. If motor cortex stimulation primarily drives small isolated muscle groups – as those two believed – then its duty is relatively rudimentary. Different portions of motor cortex work like keys on a piano, each producing its own single note. Ferrier’s findings, on the other hand, cast the motor cortex as a library of short melodies – where each stimulation causes a fragment of movement to play out cooperatively across multiple muscle groups. This argument – notes versus melodies, twitches versus movements – would be the first of many debates over the soul of the motor cortex.</p><a id="page_223"></a>
<p class="TXI">Despite the fact that he replicated their findings, Fritsch and Hitzig didn’t get along with Ferrier. This may have stemmed from a tiff over credit assignment. Ferrier felt that the German duo had slighted his mentor Jackson by not citing Jackson’s work in their own. As a result, Ferrier tried to get away with not citing Fitsch and Hitzig in his. He even went so far as to remove all references to his experiments in dogs and only talk about the results from monkeys in order to avoid any connection to Fitch and Hitzig.<sup><a href="#fn-4" id="fnt-4">4</a>
</sup> </p>
<p class="TXI">Whatever the reason, Fritsch and Hitzig didn’t trust Ferrier’s work showing the production of natural movement fragments. They stood by the superiority of short galvanic stimulation, and claimed that Ferrier’s stimulation was too long and that his findings were not replicable. Ferrier, on the other hand, remained steadfast in his belief that faradic current was best and that the quick galvanic application of Fritsch and Hitzig ‘fails to call forth the definite purposive combination of muscular contractions, which is the very essence of the reaction and the key to its interpretation’.</p>
<p class="TXI">As this fight raged on in the tiny microcosm of motor cortex stimulation, the larger field of neuroscience was having a different discussion. That function in the cortex is localised – that different areas play different roles – was something the motor crowd had clearly accepted. But in <a id="page_224"></a>the broader community, this radical change in understanding was still only just sinking in and many researchers at the time made it their goal to test the limits of this theory. Thus, the fashion became to try to stimulate as small an area of the cortex as possible to see just how localised the function could get. This trend aligned very well with Fritsch and Hitzig’s approach of using short small pulses to cause individual muscle movements. Their preferred method thus became dominant – not because it was the right way to answer the scientific question of what the motor cortex does, but because the scientific question had changed. Under the influence of the localisation craze, the fact that small muscle movements could be elicited by stimulation was more important than whether the brain normally produces movement this way. The problem of ‘twitches versus movements’ was thus put on the back burner for more than a century. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">In the brain, it doesn’t get more local than a single neuron. Neuroscientists have had the ability to record the activity of single neurons since the late 1920s. However, doing so usually required an experimental set-up – say, removing the neural tissue from the animals or at least anesthetising them during the recording – that prohibited the concurrent study of behaviour. This changed in the late 1950s, when electrodes were developed that could be dropped into the brain of an awake and responsive monkey to eavesdrop on the electrical signal of individual neurons. Reflecting on this turn in the history of neuroscience <a id="page_225"></a>some 50 years later, pioneering neuroscientist Vernon Mountcastle remarked that the field ‘has never been the same since, and one can scarcely exaggerate the thrill it was for those of us who had spent years working with anesthetised or reduced preparations to see and to work with the brain in action!’ The study of motor control – of the way in which movement and behaviour is generated by the brain – perhaps had the most to gain from this experimental advance. And indeed motor scientists were the first to use it.</p>
<p class="TXI">One of these early researchers was Edward Evarts, a psychiatrist from New York. Evarts was a generous but strict man. He took his work very personally – even turning to introspection and personal experience to aid his scientific studies on sleep and exercise – and he expected similar dedication from others. In 1967, while working at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, he finished a solo three-part project on the responses of neurons in the motor cortex. The final portion of this study focused on a question that would form the core of motor neuroscience for decades to come: what aspects of movement do neurons in the motor cortex represent?</p>
<p class="TXI">To ask this question, Evarts used a simple motor task that required only a small amount of movement. Specifically, he trained monkeys to hold on to a vertical rod and move it left and right. The monkeys were constrained to do so using only a single joint, the wrist. This meant the movement was controlled solely by two muscle groups in the forearm: the flexors, which bring the hand towards the body, and extensors, which pull it back the other way.</p> <a id="page_226"></a>
<p class="TXI">One simple hypothesis was that the firing rates of neurons in the motor cortex were directly related to the position the wrist was in at any given moment. If this were the case, you’d find neurons that fire strongly when the wrist is flexed but not when it is extended and other neurons that do the opposite. </p>
<p class="TXI">When studying movement, it makes sense to turn to the well-established mathematics of motion. An additional hypothesis for Evarts’ study therefore came from <span class="italic">kinetics</span>, the part of physics that deals with the causes of motion.<sup><a href="#fn-5" id="fnt-5">5</a>
</sup> To make the hand move, muscles in the arm contract, generating force. This force from the muscles gets turned into angular force, or torque, when it acts on the wrist joint. The torque then determines the movement and position of the hand. If motor cortex neurons encoded force instead of position, some neurons would fire strongly when the flexor muscles were producing force that moved the wrist in one direction and other neurons would fire when the extensor muscles were producing force that moves it in the other direction. </p>
<p class="TXI">In the most basic form of this experiment, these two hypotheses are indistinguishable. If a neuron is firing when the wrist is in the flexed position, is it because the wrist is in the flexed position or because of the force needed to keep it there? Who knows? If he wanted to test between these two hypotheses, Evarts needed to dissociate these two aspects of movement. To do so, he simply added counterweights to the rod. Like setting the weight on a machine at the gym, adding different counterweights to the rod makes the movements easier <a id="page_227"></a>or harder. This changes the amount of force needed to move the rod to the same position. Now firing rates could be compared when the wrist is in the same position but using different forces to get there.</p>
<p class="TXI">When looking at the 31 neurons in the motor cortex from which he recorded, Evarts saw that 26 of them had firing rates that were clearly related to force. Some of these responded strongly during wrist flexion and increased their firing as weights were added that made that flexion more difficult (or decreased their firing when weight was added in the opposite direction, making flexion easier). Other neurons preferred extensions, showing the same pattern but in the opposite direction. The remaining five neurons were difficult to interpret, but none of them showed activity that related directly to wrist position. These results made a strong case for the argument that the motor cortex encodes force.</p>
<p class="TXI">Evarts’ work on wrist forces set in motion a long trajectory of searching for kinetics in the motor system. Over the ensuing years, several other research groups sought and found kinetic information in the firing rates of motor cortex neurons as animals carried out simple movements. The legacy of localisation remains visible in this approach; it aims, after all, to understand the behaviour of individual neurons and small isolated muscle movements. But it unifies that understanding under the broader, pre-existing mathematical system of kinetics. In this view, the mathematics of the motor cortex can be found in the equations of any standard physics textbook.</p>
<p class="TXI">Evarts established the modern approach to the study of the motor cortex. He provided a well-controlled <a id="page_228"></a>experiment to explore how the activity of an individual neuron relates to the activity of muscles, and he pointed to the mathematics that could contextualise such findings. Within a few decades, however, the majority of Evarts’ signature contributions to motor science would be upended and the next era of tumult in the field would begin. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="EXT">
<span class="italic">Ah, the motor system! For better or worse, there is no coherent view of motor function by systems neuroscientists … You still have the muscle diehards [who] contend that all neural activity in motor structures, from the cerebellum to cortex, has somehow to be explained, by default, with reference to that one, real or virtual, muscle. Of course, it doesn’t make any sense… natural movements rarely, if ever, involve just one muscle.</span></p>
<p class="TXT">These are the words of Apostolos Georgopoulos, a Greek-born professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. By the time he said this in 1998, Georgopoulos had been shaking up the field of motor neuroscience for more than 15 years. Three major conceptual advances are associated with Georgopoulos (though, of course, none of them came solely from him – they existed in some form already in the scientific milieu) and of those three contributions, two remain central to the study of the motor cortex to this day. </p>
<p class="TXI">His first contribution is predictable from his quote: a focus on natural movements. Georgopoulos had trained with the famed sensory neuroscientist Vernon Mount­castle and was heavily influenced by his way of thinking. <a id="page_229"></a>Mountcastle took a holistic approach to studying the brain. He asked how bodily sensations were represented at every step – from tactile-sensing neurons in the skin up through to the use of this sensory information by higher cognitive functions in the brain. Georgopoulos wanted to bring the study of motor control into the grand tradition set upon by Mountcastle in sensory systems. In this pursuit, Georgopoulos knew he had to do away with studies of stilted single-joint movements. To understand how movement information was represented and processed by the brain, he needed to study it in the context of natural movements, in their full multi-muscle complexity. For this, he turned to one of the most basic and essential movements in a primate’s repertoire: reaching.</p>
<p class="TXI">To reach for an object in front of you, you rely on the team of muscles that surround the joints of the arm. This unsurprisingly includes the muscles of the upper arms such as the biceps and triceps. But it also involves the anterior pectoralis (a band that crosses from the centre of the chest to the arm), the anterior deltoid (a strip just in front of the armpit) and the broadest muscle in the back, the latissimus dorsi, which stretches from the lower back up to the under arm. Depending on the details of the reach, the wrist and fingers may need to be involved as well. This multi-muscle movement is a far cry from the wrist-bend experiments of Evarts. </p>
<p class="TXI">To study this multifaceted task, Georgopoulos trained monkeys to work on a small light-up table. The animals held in their hand a rod, just like you’d hold a wooden spoon when stirring a big pot. This rod was connected to a measurement device and, when a light turned on that indicated where to reach, the animals moved the <a id="page_230"></a>rod to that location. The lights were arranged in a circle, like the numbers on the face of a clock, with a radius about the length of a playing card. The monkeys always returned to the centre of the circle before reaching to the next location. With eight evenly spaced lights in the circle, the animals thus made movements in eight different directions. This simple set-up became part of a tradition of studying ‘centre-out’ reaching in motor neuroscience (see Figure 18).</p>

<p class="FC">
<span class="bold">
<span class="italic">Figure 18</span>
</span></p>
<p class="TXI">For his second contribution, Georgopoulos targeted Evarts’ kinetics theory – and replaced it with his 
own take on what neurons in the motor cortex were representing. </p>
<p class="TXI">Evarts had used wrist-flicks to see that neural activity represented force, but some scientists had found this relationship inconsistent. During more complex movements in particular, the amount of force that a muscle produces changes as the joints and muscles around it do. Moving the shoulder, for example, changes the physics of the elbow. This makes the chain of influence that runs from neural activity to muscle activity to force less interpretable and the kinetic theory <a id="page_231"></a>less viable. There were also indications that plenty of neurons cared very little about force at all. </p>
<p class="TXI">So Georgopoulos flipped the perspective. Rather than asking what neurons were saying about the muscles, he asked what they were saying about the movement. In more than a third of the neurons in motor cortex, he found a very clear and simple relationship between neural activity and the <span class="italic">direction</span> the arm was moving. Specifically, these neurons had a preferred direction. This means they would fire the most when the animal reached in that direction – say towards three o’clock – and their rate of firing would fall off the farther the movement was from this direction (lower firing for two and four o’clock, lower still for one and five o’clock, <span class="italic">etc.</span>). The finding of this ‘direction tuning’ implied that the motor cortex cared more about <span class="italic">kinematics</span> than kinetics. After ‘twitches vs movements’, kinetics vs kinematics became the next big debate in motor neuroscience. </p>
<p class="TXI">Kinematics are descriptive features of motion, defined without regard to the forces that generate them. In this way, kinematic variables indicate the desired outcome for the arm, but not the instructions for how to create it. Going from a model wherein the motor cortex encodes kinetics to one wherein it encodes kinematics shifts the distribution of labour in the motor system. A kinetic variable such as force is only a few small calculations removed from the actual level of muscle activity needed to enact it – transformations potentially performed by neurons in the spinal cord – but because kinematic values only define where the arm should be in space, they pose a larger challenge to the rest of the motor system. The burden is thus on areas downstream of the <a id="page_232"></a>motor cortex to change the coordinate system: to take a set of desired locations external to the body and turn it into patterns of muscle activity. Georgopoulos became an adamant and unceasing defender of this kinematic take on the motor cortex for decades to come. </p>
<p class="TXI">The final change ushered in by Georgopoulos was in how to look at the data. If neurons are tuned to the overall direction of the movement, it means that they are not involved in one-to-one control of muscles. Why, then, should neurons be looked at one at a time? Instead, it would be more sensible to consider what all the neurons – the entire population – are saying.</p>
<p class="TXI">And that is what Georgopoulos did. Using the information he had about direction tuning in individual cells, he calculated a ‘population vector’ – essentially an arrow that points in the direction of movement that the neural population is encoding. This calculation works by allowing each neuron to vote for its preferred direction of movement. But this is no perfect democracy, because not all votes are weighted equally. Instead the weight of a neuron’s vote comes from how active the neuron is. So, neurons firing high above average can strongly bias the population vector in their preferred direction. And neurons firing well below average would bias this vector <span class="italic">away</span> from their preferred direction. In this way, the neurons collectively indicate the desired movement direction. And they do so in a way that is more accurate than an individual neuron can be.<sup><a href="#fn-6" id="fnt-6">6</a>
</sup> Georgopoulos <a id="page_233"></a>showed that by summing up each neuron’s contribution in this way he could, in fact, accurately read out the direction in which the animal was moving its arm on any given instance. </p>
<p class="TXI">This population-level approach to the data proved quite powerful – perhaps too powerful. After this work, several studies emerged showing other information that could be read out from the motor cortex if the whole population was taken into account: finger movement, arm speed, muscle activity, force, position and even sensory information about the visual cues indicating where and when to move. Direction may have been one of the original variables decoded in this way, but it was far from unique. Finding both kinetic and kinematic variables (and a host of other information) in the activity was a blow against Georgopoulos’ theory that kinematics is special. Ironically, it was one of his own contributions – a focus on the population – that undermined him. </p>
<p class="TXI">Faith in what information read out from the motor cortex tells us about its function declined even further through the use of computational approaches. Scientists who built models of the motor system, which they <span class="italic">designed</span> to work by encoding kinetic variables, were able to show how kinematic variables could be read out from them as well. One such scientist – Eberhard Fetz – went so far as to compare the hunt for variable representations in the motor cortex to the behaviour of fortune tellers: <a id="page_234"></a>‘Like reading tea leaves, this approach can be used to create an impression, by projecting conceptual schemes on to suggestive patterns.’ </p>
<p class="TXI">These findings revealed a possibility that was always lurking just under the surface: there is no single value that neurons in the motor cortex ‘code for’. It’s not kinematics <span class="italic">or</span> kinetics; it’s both, and more, and neither. In many ways, this fact was visible all along. It could be seen in the neurons that didn’t show neat responses to force or direction, or in the neurons that showed big changes in their responses with small changes in the experiment, or simply in the decades-long volley of researchers finding evidence for one side and then the other over and over again.</p>
<p class="TXI">By some accounts, the field was led astray because it blindly followed the path laid by other scientists: the study of sensory systems that so inspired Georgopoulos was a poor model for how to understand movement. The debate over ‘what does the motor cortex encode?’ was unresolved not because the question is hard, but because it was the wrong one to ask from the start. The motor system doesn’t need to track movement parameters, it just needs to produce movements. </p>
<p class="TXI">As was shown in the last chapter, just because scientists can see structure in neural activity doesn’t mean the brain is using it. A common analogy compares the motor cortex to the engine of a car. The engine is surely responsible for the movement of the car. And if one were to measure the activity of its different parts – the piston, the engine belts, <span class="italic">etc.</span> – it’s likely that some of these values would, under some conditions, correlate quite strongly with the force generated by the car or with the direction <a id="page_235"></a>in which it is turning. But would we say the engine works by ‘encoding’ these variables? Or is this more a convention brought to the motor cortex by scientists who themselves understand movement through concepts of force, mechanics and physics? As motor neuroscientist John Kalaska wrote in 2009: ‘Joint torque is a Newtonian mechanical parameter that defines the rotational force required to produce a particular joint motion … It is highly unlikely that a [motor cortex] neuron knows what a Newton-meter is or how to calculate how many Newton-meters are needed to generate a particular movement.’</p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">Just because ‘what does the motor cortex encode?’ was the wrong question to ask to understand the motor cortex doesn’t mean the answer has no value. Indeed, trying to decode information from the motor cortex can be quite useful – not in aid of understanding the motor system, but in bypassing it altogether. </p>
<p class="TXI">When, in a small room outside Providence, Rhode Island, a 55-year-old woman named Cathy Hutchinson brought a cup of coffee to her mouth and took a sip, it was the first time she’d done so in more than 15 years. It was also the first time any tetraplegic person achieved this feat. Hutchinson became paralysed from the neck down when she was 39, after suffering a stroke while gardening on a spring day in 1996. According to a <span class="italic">Wired</span> interview, she heard about BrainGate – a research group housed at Brown University that explores the use of brain-computer interfaces to restore mobility to <a id="page_236"></a>patients – from a friend who worked at the hospital. Hutchinson enrolled in their clinical trial.</p>
<p class="TXI">As part of their study, the BrainGate scientists implanted a device in Cathy’s brain – a square piece of metal smaller than the average shirt button, consisting of 96 electrodes, placed in the arm-controlling region of her left motor cortex. The activities of neurons recorded through these electrodes are fed through a wire out of her head and into a computer system. This machine connects to a robotic arm placed on a stand to Cathy’s right. The arm itself is alien – bulbous, awkward and a shiny blue – but the hand at the end of it is more recognisable, with subtle detailed joints in a matte silver. When Cathy controls it, the movements are not smooth. The arm halts and moves backwards before eventually bringing the coffee towards her. But ultimately it gets the job done – and a woman who lost the ability to move her own limbs gained the ability to move this one. </p>
<p class="TXI">Even this simple, imperfect control did not come immediately. For the machine to know how to listen to Cathy’s motor cortex it had to be trained. BrainGate achieves this by having Cathy imagine moving her arm in different directions. The patterns in the neural activity can then be related to commands to move the arm in different directions. In this way, the control of this brain-computer interface depends on the presence of direction tuning in the motor cortex. That is, if it weren’t possible to read out movement direction – and other intentions such as grasp or release – from a population of motor cortex cells, brain-computer interfaces wouldn’t work. </p>
<p class="TXI">These devices also depend on a lot of heavy mathematical machinery that runs behind the scenes. To <a id="page_237"></a>try to make the movements as smooth as possible, for example, BrainGate uses an algorithm that combines input from the neural activity with information about past movement direction. Furthermore, some of the fine-grained movements of the robot hand and wrist are pre-programmed into the device, so that the user can initiate a full, detailed motor sequence by imagining a simple command. This is a practical workaround for how difficult it is to read out detailed motor commands from the activity of a group of neurons. </p>
<p class="TXI">Such laboured efforts to build brain-controlled motor devices, while offering some hope to patients, highlight just how little we understand the role the motor cortex plays in healthy movement. </p>
<p class="center">* * *</p>
<p class="TXT">If decoding is more useful for engineering than understanding, what <span class="italic">can</span> we use to make sense of the motor cortex? </p>
<p class="TXI">Focusing on the population has remained popular – and with good reason. The neurons of the motor cortex must to some extent be working together to generate movements; after all, the human motor cortex is allotted hundreds of millions of neurons to control the roughly 800 muscles of the human body. But this poses a challenge for scientists: how can they make sense of the activity of the hundreds of neurons normally recorded in the course of an experiment? In the population vector approach taken by Georgopoulos, beliefs about what the neurons were doing was built in: if the neurons are encoding direction, then direction is what is read out. <a id="page_238"></a>But as motor neuroscientists tried to move away from the question of what the motor cortex encodes to what the motor cortex <span class="italic">does</span>, approaches based on reading out specific information didn’t make sense. They needed to find a new way to look at the population. </p>
<p class="TXI">The fundamental difference between a single neuron vs a population approach to the study of the motor cortex is one of <span class="italic">dimensionality</span>. While the space we live in is three-dimensional, many of the systems scientists study have much higher dimensionality. The activity of a population of 100 neurons, for example, would be 100-dimensional. </p>
<p class="TXI">How this abstract, high-dimensional ‘neural space’ relates at all to real, tangible, physical space can be difficult to see. But we can build off our intuitions about physical space by first considering a population with only three neurons. Specifically, by replacing metres or feet with the number of spikes a neuron fires, the activity of this population can be described just like a location in space. When producing a movement, for example, the first neuron in the population may fire five spikes, the second fifteen, and the third nine. This provides coordinates in neural space, the same way a treasure map describes how many paces to walk forwards, then to the right, then how deep to dig. A different pattern of neural activity would point to a different location in neural space. By looking at the neural activity of the motor cortex across a variety of movements, scientists can ask if different locations in this space correspond to different types or components of movement. </p>
<p class="TXI">Visualising this activity, though, becomes tricky in a larger population. Humans, based as we are in our <a id="page_239"></a>three-dimensional world, have trouble thinking beyond it. What would neural space look like if a fourth neuron were added to the population? What if there were a hundred neurons, or a thousand? Our intuitions fall apart here. Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton offers the best advice for this problem: ‘To deal with hyper-planes in a fourteen-dimensional space, visualise a 3-D space and say “fourteen” to yourself very loudly.’</p>
<p class="TXI">Luckily there is another way around the problem of having too many dimensions: dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is a mathematical technique that can take information in a high-dimensional space and represent it using fewer dimensions. It is based on the premise that some of these original dimensions are redundant – in this case, that would mean that multiple neurons are saying the same thing. If you could figure out what patterns of neural activity in a 100-dimension population are fundamental to that population – and which are just recycled combinations of those fundamental patterns – you could explain that neural population with fewer than 100 dimensions. </p>
<p class="TXI">Consider personality. How many dimensions are there to human personality? The English language has a dizzying list of possible descriptors: agreeable, flexible, self-critical, kind, forgiving, creative, charismatic, calm, intelligent, disciplined, aggressive, meticulous, serious, clever, and on and on and on. Each of these could be thought of as a separate dimension, with each person described by a location in this high-dimensional personality space based on how they score on them. But there are some personality traits that seem to correlate. For example, ‘clever’ people may also frequently be <a id="page_240"></a>considered ‘quick-witted’. Maybe it would be more appropriate to think of cleverness and quick-wittedness as two measures of the same underlying trait – perhaps we call it ‘intelligence’. If this is the case then the two dimensions representing cleverness and quick-wittedness in this space can be replaced by one for intelligence. This reduces the dimensionality. If there is only an occasional person who is clever but not quick-witted or quick-witted but not clever, then this reduction doesn’t sacrifice much. For the vast majority of people, describing them according to intelligence alone will tell us what we need to know about these aspects of their personality. </p>
<p class="TXI">Indeed, most popular personality tests are based on the premise that just a handful of core traits can explain the full human diversity. For example, the famed Myers-Briggs test claims personality has just four axes: intuition vs sensing, feeling vs thinking, introversion vs extraversion and perception vs judging. A more scientifically grounded approach (known as the Big Five) places the dimensionality of personality at five: agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness and openness. These are referred to as ‘latent’ factors, because they can be thought of as the basic underlying traits that generate the many different personality styles we see.</p>
<p class="TXI">The historic tradition in neuroscience of treating each neuron as a snowflake – unique and worthy of individual analysis – assumes that they are, in some sense, the base unit of the brain. That is, it assumes that nature has packaged the relevant dimensions into a neat cellular form. But just as our folk notions of personality over-represent its dimensionality, there are many reasons why the ‘true’ dimensionality of a neural population is likely <a id="page_241"></a>to be less than the number of neurons in it. For example, redundancy is a smart feature to have in any biological system. Neurons are noisy and can die, which makes a system with redundant ones more robust.<sup><a href="#fn-7" id="fnt-7">7</a>
</sup> Furthermore, neurons tend to be heavily interconnected. With all their talking back and forth with each other, it’s unlikely that any one of them can remain very independent. Instead, their activity becomes correlated the same way that the opinions of people in the same social circles start to converge. For these reasons, neural populations are ripe for applying dimensionality reduction techniques that can help identify the latent factors truly driving them. </p>
<p class="TXI">A popular dimensionality reduction technique for neural data is principal components analysis, or PCA (see Figure 19). PCA was invented in the 1930s and used extensively by psychologists to analyse mental traits and faculties. Because of how useful it is for making sense of big datasets, it’s now applied to all kinds of data across many fields. </p>
<p class="TXI">PCA works though a focus on <span class="italic">variance</span>. Variance refers to how spread out different data points are. If, for example, over the course of three nights a person sleeps for 8 hours, 8 hours and 5 minutes, and 7 hours and 55 minutes, they would be a low-variance sleeper. A high-variance sleeper may also sleep for 8 hours on average but would spread it out very differently over three nights – say 6 hours, 10 hours and 8 hours.</p> <a id="page_242"></a>
<p class="TXI">Dimensions with high variance are important because they can be quite informative. It’s easier, for example, to read the emotional state of someone who is sometimes quiet and sometimes screaming than a stoic who always has the same straight face. Similarly, it is easier to categorise people by traits that vary a lot across people, rather than ones that everyone has in common. Recognising the importance of variance, the goal of PCA is to find new dimensions – which are a combination of the original dimensions the same way intelligence could be a combination of cleverness and quick-wittedness – that capture as much of the variance in the data as possible. This means that knowing where a data point falls according to these new dimensions will still tell us a lot about it, even if there are fewer of them. </p>
<p class="TXI">For example, consider a two-neuron population whose activity we would like to describe with just a single number. Let’s say we recorded the activity of these two neurons during different movements, so for each movement we have a pair of numbers representing the number of spikes from each. If we plot these pairs using the x-axis for one neuron and the y-axis for another, we <a id="page_243"></a>may see that the data falls more or less along a line. That line then can be our new dimension. Now, instead of describing the activity during each movement as a pair of numbers we can describe it as a single number, which refers to where it falls on this line.</p>

<p class="TXI">Reducing the dimensionality in this way does leave off some information. We don’t know, for example, how far the activity is from that line if we only describe where it falls on it – but the point is to pick the line that captures the most variance and thus loses the least information. </p>
<p class="TXI">If the data doesn’t fall along a line – that is, if the activity of the two neurons is not similar at all – then this won’t work very well. In that case we would say that this two-dimensional neural population is indeed using its full two dimensions and so can’t be reduced. But, as discussed previously, there are many reasons why, on average, some neural activity is redundant and so dimensionality reduction is possible. </p>
<p class="TXI">Dimensionality reduction has been successfully applied to all kinds of neural data over the years. PCA itself was applied as early as 1978, when it was used to show that the activity of eight neurons responsible for encoding the position of the knee could be well represented by just one or two dimensions. And the use of PCA in studies of the motor cortex has only ramped up in the past decade. This is because dimensionality reduction helps motor scientists see what would otherwise be hidden. Condensing the ups and downs of the activity of over a hundred neurons into a single line makes their patterns visible to the naked eye. Looking at the evolution of a population’s activity as a shape traced out in three dimensions allows scientists to use their <a id="page_244"></a>intuitions about space to understand what neurons are doing. Seeing these trajectories can therefore seed new stories about how the motor system works. </p>
<p class="TXI">Studies conducted in the lab of Krishna Shenoy at Stanford University in the early 2010s, for example, asked how the motor cortex <span class="italic">prepares</span> for movements. To do this, they trained monkeys to perform standard arm reaches, but they introduced a delay between when the location for the movement was given and when the animal should actually start moving. This made it possible to record from the motor cortex while it was preparing to move. </p>
<p class="TXI">The long-held assumption was that, in preparing for movements, motor cortex neurons would fire in a pattern similar to how they fire during the movement, just at lower overall rates. That is, they’d essentially be saying the same thing but quieter. In neural activity space, this would put the preparatory activity in the same direction as the movement activity, but just not quite as far along. However, by plotting a low-dimensional version of the neural activity as the animal planned for and then executed a movement, the researchers found this was not the case. The activity before the movement was not simply a restrained version of that during the movement; instead, it occupied a different area of the activity space entirely. </p>
<p class="TXI">This finding, while surprising, is consistent with a more modern view of the motor cortex. This new view puts emphasis on the fact that the motor cortex is a dynamical system – that the neurons within it interact in a way that makes them capable of producing complex patterns of activity over time. Because of these interactions between its neurons, the motor cortex has the ability to take in short, simple inputs, and produce <a id="page_245"></a>elaborate and extended outputs in return. What makes this so useful is that it means another brain region could decide where the arm should be, send that information to the motor cortex, and the motor cortex would produce the full trajectory of neural activity needed to make the arm get there.</p>
<p class="TXI">In this framework, the preparatory activity represents an ‘initial state’ of this dynamical system. Initial states define the location in activity space that the population starts at, but it is the connections among neurons that determine where it goes. In this way, initial states work a little like the entries to different water slides at the top of a platform: the location of the entry can have little to do with the course of the slide or where it ends up. Therefore, there is no reason preparatory activity needs to look like the activity during movement. All that matters is that the motor cortex gets to the right initial state and the connections among its own neurons will do the rest. </p>
<p class="TXI">This ‘dynamical systems’ view has the potential to explain why attempts to make sense of the motor cortex have been so confounded. Thinking of these neurons as part of a larger machinery – where some parts are guiding muscle movements in the moment, but others are planning for the next step – the diversity and malleability of their responses are more expected. This new take also, ironically, brings the field back to its roots. A model where a simple input can produce a complex output provides a nice fit to Ferrier’s findings that stimulation produces extended naturalistic movements. And Ferrier was indeed vindicated in the early 2000s, when Princeton professor Michael Graziano showed – using modern stimulation techniques – that half-second-long stimulation of the motor cortex elicits complex and <a id="page_246"></a>coordinated natural movements, such as bringing a hand to the mouth or a changing of facial expression. </p>

<p class="TXT">It is not uncommon for scientists to admit what they do not know. After all, science only exists in the gaps between knowledge, so identifying and recognising these gaps is an important part of the process. But researchers of the motor system seem particularly extreme in their declarations of ignorance. They fill paragraphs with talk of the ‘considerable debate’ in their field and how there is ‘remarkably little agreement regarding even the basic response properties of the motor cortex’. They are quick to admit as well that ‘a deep understanding of the motor cortex function still eludes us’ and that ‘it remains an open question how neural responses in the motor cortex relate to movement’. And in their more desperate moments they even ask: ‘Why has this seemingly simple question been so difficult to answer?’ </p>
<p class="TXI">While still couched in the dry detachment of academic writing, these words indicate an honest acknowledgement of an unfortunate truth: that despite being both one of the earliest areas of cortex ever explored and one of the first to have single neuron activity recorded during behaviour, the motor cortex still remains deeply, stubbornly mysterious. As we have seen, of course, this is not for lack of trying: heroic work and vigorous debates have marked the history of this field – and, certainly, many inroads have been made. Yet, few of the major controversies have been fully settled – save, presumably, for the issue of whether the motor cortex exists and the fact that it does something at all.</p>
<p class="H1">Notes</p>
<p class="FN1"><a href="chapter8.xhtml#fnt-1" id="fn-1">1</a> ﻿Technically this describes the ﻿‘﻿primary﻿’﻿ motor cortex. Another region known as the ﻿‘﻿premotor cortex﻿’﻿ sits just in front of the primary motor cortex. These areas are frequently studied together and we will not attempt to differentiate between them in this chapter.﻿</p>
<p class="FN1"><a href="chapter8.xhtml#fnt-2" id="fn-2">2</a> ﻿Including what we would now call ﻿‘﻿scientific racism﻿’﻿. Fritsch collected samples of retina and hair in a vain attempt to make statements about white racial superiority.﻿</p>
<p class="FN1"><a href="chapter8.xhtml#fnt-3" id="fn-3">3</a> ﻿Like many scientists of his time, Ferrier engaged in animal experimentation techniques that would never pass ethical review today. Unlike many scientists of his time, however, Ferrier actually got in trouble for it. After Ferrier brought a lesioned animal on stage to demonstrate his findings in 1881, anti-vivisectionists had him arrested for performing an experiment without a licence. As it turned out, his associate, who did have a licence, was the one who had performed the surgery and Ferrier got off. But it was a strong sign from the animal rights crowd.﻿</p>
<p class="FN1"><a href="chapter8.xhtml#fnt-4" id="fn-4">4</a> ﻿Over time, however, Ferrier seemed to cool. In his book published three years after the citation fight, he wrote: ﻿‘﻿The credit of having first experimentally demonstrated the fact of definite localisation belongs to [Hitzig] and his colleague Fritsch, and I regret that in the acrimonious discussions which have arisen in regard to the subject, I have been interpreted as implying otherwise.﻿’﻿﻿</p>
<p class="FN1"><a href="chapter8.xhtml#fnt-5" id="fn-5">5</a> ﻿Also commonly referred to as ﻿‘﻿dynamics﻿’﻿.﻿</p>
<p class="FN1"><a href="chapter8.xhtml#fnt-6" id="fn-6">6</a> ﻿To understand this, consider the previously described neuron that prefers movement towards three o﻿’﻿clock. That neuron has a unique firing rate for three o﻿’﻿clock, but may fire at the same rate for movements towards two and four o﻿’﻿clock, making those directions indistinguishable. When combining information from that neuron with others that have different preferred directions, however, that ambiguity can be resolved. ﻿</p>
<p class="FN1"><a href="chapter8.xhtml#fnt-7" id="fn-7">7</a> ﻿This is technically at odds with Barlow﻿’﻿s notions of efficient and sparse coding from the last chapter. Practically speaking, the brain needs to balance efficient information transmission with the need to be robust and so should have some redundancy. ﻿</p>
