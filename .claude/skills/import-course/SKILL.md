# Import Course

## Overview

This skill automates the process of importing a course from an EPUB book into the Brainer database. It reads course-plan.json files from book directories (generated by `/reformat-epub`), translates titles to French, and creates all entities in the database via REST API calls.

**Prerequisites:** The book must have been processed by `/reformat-epub` first to generate the `course-plan.json` file.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user wants to:
- Import a new book/course into Brainer (after running `/reformat-epub`)
- Add a course from the books/ directory to the database
- Create the course structure (course, parts, chapters) in the database

**Important:** Run `/reformat-epub` first to generate the `course-plan.json` file.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Clear Temp Directory

**The script automatically clears the `temp/` directory at startup** to ensure a clean state.

### Step 1: Find Course Plan

Search for `course-plan.json` files in book directories within `books/`:
- If a specific book directory name is provided, load its `course-plan.json`
- If no name provided, list all available books with `course-plan.json` files
- The script looks for: `books/<book-directory>/course-plan.json`

**Note:** The `course-plan.json` file is generated by the `/reformat-epub` skill and contains the complete course structure.

### Step 2: Load Course Structure

Load the `course-plan.json` file from the book directory:
- Contains course metadata (title, slug, author)
- Contains parts structure with order and titles
- Contains chapters with order, titles, slugs, and source files
- No parsing needed - the file is already in the correct format

### Step 3: Translate to French and Generate Description

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: All titles must be translated to French and a course description must be generated.**

1. Read the `course-plan.json` file from the book directory
2. Translate ALL titles (course, parts, chapters) to French:
   - **NOT literal translation** - use pedagogical, comprehensible French
   - Preserve technical terms when appropriate (e.g., "Data Engineering" → "Ingénierie des données")
   - Make titles clear and educational (e.g., "Getting Started" → "Premiers pas")
3. **Generate a concise course description** (1-2 sentences):
   - Summarize what the course covers
   - Highlight key topics and technologies
   - Keep it clear and informative (NOT just author name)
   - Example: "Guide complet de Docker, des concepts de base aux fonctionnalités avancées : conteneurs, images, réseaux, volumes, Compose, Swarm et sécurité."
4. Save the translated version as `temp/course-plan-fr.json`
5. The script will use the French version for database import

**Translation Guidelines:**
- Course title: Clear, professional French (e.g., "Fundamentals of Data Engineering" → "Principes fondamentaux de l'ingénierie des données")
- Course description: Concise 1-2 sentence summary highlighting key topics (NOT author name)
- Part titles: Natural French structure (e.g., "Part I: Introduction" → "Partie I : Introduction")
- **Chapter titles: ALWAYS include "Chapter X:" prefix** (e.g., "Chapter 1: Getting Started" → "Chapitre 1 : Premiers pas")
  - The `course-plan.json` file automatically includes "Chapter X:" prefix in all chapter titles
  - Translate "Chapter" to "Chapitre" and add proper French spacing before the colon
  - Keep titles educational and clear
- Keep technical keywords recognizable for search/SEO

### Step 4: Create Course in Database

Make API calls to create the course structure:

1. **Create Course** (`POST /api/courses`)
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Course title from TOC (in French)",
     "slug": "course-slug",
     "description": "Brief 1-2 sentence course description (in French)"
   }
   ```

2. **Create Parts** (`POST /api/courses/{slug}/parts` for each part)
   ```json
   {
     "order": 1,
     "title": "Part title from TOC",
     "description": ""
   }
   ```

3. **Create Chapters** (`POST /api/courses/{slug}/chapters` for each chapter)
   ```json
   {
     "part_id": 123,
     "order": 1,
     "title": "Chapter title from TOC",
     "slug": "chapter-slug",
     "content": "<p>Chapter content will be added later</p>"
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Report Results

Display a summary:
- Course created with slug (in French)
- Number of parts created
- Number of chapters created
- Direct link to view the course in the frontend

## Important Notes

- **Prerequisites:** Run `/reformat-epub` first to generate `course-plan.json` in the book directory
- **Backend must be running** on `http://localhost:8000` (or configured API URL)
- **All titles MUST be in French** - the skill translates and uses `temp/course-plan-fr.json`
- **Temp directory is cleared** at the start of each import to ensure a clean state
- The skill creates the **structure only** (course, parts, chapters with placeholder content)
- Chapter **content extraction** from XHTML files is done separately via `/create-chapters`
- Images are handled by the `/create-chapters` skill
- If the course slug already exists in the database, the API will return an error

## Script Reference

This skill uses `.claude/skills/import-course/scripts/import_course.py` which:
- Clears the `temp/` directory at startup for a clean state
- Finds `course-plan.json` files in book directories
- Loads the course plan from the book directory
- Expects Claude to translate titles and create `temp/course-plan-fr.json`
- Makes REST API calls using the `requests` library
- Handles errors gracefully (missing files, API failures, etc.)
- Reads API URL from environment variable `API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`)

## Example Usage

**User request:**
> "Import the Docker Deep Dive book into the database"

**Skill actions:**
1. Clear `temp/` directory
2. Find `books/deep-dive-docker/course-plan.json`
3. Load course plan (English version)
4. **Translate to French** → generate `temp/course-plan-fr.json` with:
   - Course: "Docker en profondeur"
   - Parts: "Partie I : Introduction à Docker", etc.
   - Chapters: "Chapitre 1 : Les conteneurs - Vue d'ensemble", etc.
5. Create course with slug `deep-dive-docker` (from course plan)
6. Create parts (with French titles)
7. Create chapters (with French titles)
8. Report: "✅ Course imported successfully! View at http://localhost:3000/courses/deep-dive-docker"

## Resources

### .claude/skills/import-course/scripts/import_course.py
Python script that performs the actual import:
- Clears `temp/` directory at startup
- Finds and validates `course-plan.json` files in book directories
- Loads course plan from book directory
- Waits for Claude to create French translation in `temp/course-plan-fr.json`
- Makes API requests to create course entities
- Provides detailed progress and error reporting

Usage:
```bash
source brainer_venv/bin/activate

# Prerequisites: Run /reformat-epub first to generate course-plan.json

# Import course (requires temp/course-plan-fr.json to exist)
python .claude/skills/import-course/scripts/import_course.py "Book Directory Name"

# Example:
python .claude/skills/import-course/scripts/import_course.py "deep-dive-docker"
```

**Note:** The book directory name should match the directory in `books/` that contains `course-plan.json`.
